# Running the codes

1. Download all the codes within the Codes folder subject_task. All the codes should be in the same folder 
2. Add the pose.mat and data.mat to that folder. So, now the folder has all the codes and data.mat, pose.mat
3. From Terminal go inside this folder. Use linux syntax with cd .../subject_task
4. Run the python script as python KNN_Scratch_expressions.py *******[python (space) code_name]*****

The code will run with the default parameters. Now if you need to change the parameters. Open the .py files.
Go down and change the two main variables 

Parameters
1. components = 2 /3 etc.
2. transform = 'MDA' or 'PCA' 
3. Run the script with python KNN_Scratch_expressions.py command

Note, you can change other things like seed, no of iterations etc which are well commented. Just need to open the .py file and make the changes.

Output : The figures will be saved inside the folders. In some cases, I print the value also. If you want/don;t want please edit the print lines at the end in the .py files.


### Important

********For the expressions task, run the codes which has subscript expressions, will run on data.mat*******
***********For the subject task, the codes with subscript subject, will run on pose.mat****************

****** Most important is that pose.mat and data.mat and all the codes should be the folder. The python terminal should run inside that folder ********************
******************* Name of the dataset should be kept data.mat and pose.mat *************************************
